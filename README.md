This study explores the text-based ideal points model (TBIP), assessing its functionality and applicability in the context of the United Kingdom's political landscape. We aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of political discourse and ideological shifts.
The study examines whether TBIP, a probabilistic topic model developed by Vafa et al. (2020)[^1], effectively positions politicians along an interpretable political spectrum in a multiparty context and explores its ability to capture the evolution of word choices and political preferences over time. Additionally, the paper delves into the model's design choices and its variational inference algorithm.
Through experiments comparing TBIP with a traditional vote-based ideal point model, the study evaluates the model's performance and identifies potential areas for improvement. Notably, while TBIP demonstrates promise in classifying political stances, it falls short in comparison to the benchmark model, suggesting the need for further refinement and adaptation to diverse political contexts.
